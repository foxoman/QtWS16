Integrating Qt and Native Views examples
==========================================================

This directory contains several examples showing how to use
Qt and native views/windows interchangeably in applications.

The examples currently have a dependency on the "remac"
research branch available at:

    https://github.com/msorvig/qtbase-remac

The examples should work out-of the box using that branch. Defects or
suggestions can be reported as issues on this repository.

Examples include:

    fullsizedcontentview    Qt content below (transparent) window title bar
    hudwindow               Qt content on HUD-type window
    accessoryview           Qt content on window title and toolbar area
    popover                 Qt content on a special popup menu.
    visualeffects           VisualEffects QWindow with blur effect
    toolbar                 Qt unified toolbar examples.
